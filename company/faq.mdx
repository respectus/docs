## Getting Started

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What makes Lexa different?">
    Lexa is Cerevox's enterprise-grade document parsing API that delivers 10x better performance and accuracy compared to traditional solutions. Unlike other APIs that struggle with complex layouts and structured data, Lexa uses state-of-the-art AI models to extract content with 99.9% accuracy while maintaining native async support and vector database optimization.
    
    Key differentiators:
    - **SOTA accuracy** with advanced ML models
    - **10x faster** processing with sub-second response times
    - **Vector DB ready** chunks optimized for RAG applications
    - **12+ file formats** with consistent results
    - **Enterprise-grade** reliability with 99.9% SLA
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How quickly can I integrate?">
    You can start parsing documents in under 5 minutes:
    
    ```python
    pip install cerevox
    ```
    
    ```python
    from cerevox import Lexa
    
    client = Lexa(api_key="your-api-key")
    documents = client.parse(["document.pdf"])
    
    # Get vector DB ready chunks
    chunks = documents.get_all_text_chunks(target_size=500)
    ```
    
    Our Python SDK handles authentication, retries, and error handling automatically. We also provide comprehensive examples for Django, Flask, FastAPI, and async applications.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What formats does Lexa support?">
    Lexa supports 12+ file formats with consistent, high-accuracy parsing:
    
    **Documents**: PDF, DOCX, PPTX, TXT, HTML, RTF  
    **Spreadsheets**: XLSX, CSV, TSV  
    **Google Workspace**: Google Docs, Sheets, Slides  
    **Data**: JSON, Parquet  
    
    All formats support advanced table extraction, image detection, and metadata preservation. File size limits range from 100MB for complex documents to 1GB+ for simple text files.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Technical Implementation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How does async processing work?">
    Lexa provides native async support with the `AsyncLexa` client:
    
    ```python
    import asyncio
    from cerevox import AsyncLexa
    
    async def main():
        async with AsyncLexa(api_key="your-api-key") as client:
            # Process multiple documents concurrently
            documents = await client.parse([
                "report1.pdf", "report2.docx", "data.xlsx"
            ])
            
            # Batch process with progress tracking
            async for status in client.parse_with_progress(files):
                print(f"Progress: {status.progress}")
    
    asyncio.run(main())
    ```
    
    This enables concurrent processing of multiple documents, significantly improving throughput for batch operations.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I optimize for RAG applications?">
    Lexa is designed specifically for RAG workflows with built-in vector database optimization:
    
    ```python
    # Get optimally sized chunks for embeddings
    chunks = documents.get_all_text_chunks(
        target_size=500,  # Optimal for most embedding models
        overlap=50,       # Maintain context between chunks
        include_metadata=True  # Rich metadata for filtering
    )
    
    # Direct integration with vector databases
    for chunk in chunks:
        # Each chunk includes source document, page numbers,
        # element types, and confidence scores
        vector_db.upsert(
            id=chunk.id,
            vector=embed(chunk.content),
            metadata=chunk.metadata
        )
    ```
    
    We provide pre-built integration examples for Pinecone, Weaviate, ChromaDB, and Qdrant.
  </Accordion>

## Advanced Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How does table extraction work in complex documents?">
    Lexa uses advanced computer vision and ML models to extract tables with high fidelity:
    
    ```python
    documents = client.parse("financial_report.pdf")
    
    # Access extracted tables
    for doc in documents:
        for table in doc.tables:
            print(f"Table on page {table.page_number}")
            print(f"Dimensions: {table.rows}x{table.columns}")
            
            # Export to pandas DataFrame
            df = table.to_pandas()
            
            # Or get raw structured data
            data = table.to_dict()
    ```
    
    Features include:
    - **Structure preservation**: Maintains cell relationships and formatting
    - **Multi-page tables**: Automatically combines split tables
    - **Header detection**: Identifies and preserves table headers
    - **Data type inference**: Automatically detects numbers, dates, etc.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I customize the parsing behavior for my use case?">
    Lexa offers several processing modes and customization options:
    
    ```python
    from cerevox import ProcessingMode
    
    # Standard processing (fastest)
    docs = client.parse("document.pdf", mode=ProcessingMode.DEFAULT)
    
    # Advanced processing (highest accuracy)
    docs = client.parse("document.pdf", mode=ProcessingMode.ADVANCED)
    
    # Custom chunking parameters
    chunks = docs.get_text_chunks(
        target_size=1000,      # Larger chunks for long-form content
        tolerance=0.2,         # 20% size variance allowed
        respect_boundaries=True, # Don't break sentences/paragraphs
        include_tables=True    # Include table content in chunks
