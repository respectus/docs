At Cerevox, we've recognized a critical challenge in managing and extracting value from diverse datasets while maintaining trust and verifiability in the results.

## The State of Data

Organizations today are inundated with data across multiple formats - PDFs, spreadsheets, text documents, presentations, and more. The challenge isn't just in accessing this information, but in efficiently analyzing it while maintaining clear traceability back to the source. Traditional tools often struggle with cross-document analysis, especially when dealing with large volumes of data across different file types. This complexity makes it difficult for analysts, researchers, and decision-makers to quickly find and verify the information they need.
