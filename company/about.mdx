At Cerevox, we've recognized a significant data challenge faced by businesses today

## The State of Data

A staggering 90% of all files produced to-date are unstructured. These unstructured files, which encompass a wide array of formats like PDFs, .txt files, word documents, audio files, and emails, present a formidable barrier. They cannot be readily processed by essential business development tools or harnessed by Large Language Models (LLMs). Both these tools demand structured JSON data to enable effective analysis. The conversion of messy, unstructured data into a format that aligns with these models poses substantial challenges, particularly for developers who lack specialized data engineering expertise. Furthermore, even after the data has been structured, ongoing data management and maintenance introduce complexities that can be overwhelming.

## A World with Cerevox

We're building a fully managed pipeline that simplifies the process for developers to ingest unstructured data and transform it into a format ready for utilization with Large Language Models (LLMs). Our innovative approach ensures that businesses can harness their unstructured data, irrespective of file type, document layout, or location. 

But that's not all. We've gone a step further. Cerevox has developed a custom parser that empowers users to customize file transformations. With our user-friendly, no-code interface, customers can easily set their own parameters, resulting in precisely the output they desire, every time.
