# Hippo Quickstart - 5 Minutes to Q&A ü¶õ

Build an AI Q&A system that answers questions from your documents with source citations.

## Prerequisites

<Check>
  **Before you start:**
  - Python 3.9+ installed
  - Cerevox API key ([get one here](https://cerevox.ai))
  - `pip install cerevox` completed
</Check>

## The 4-Step Workflow

Hippo follows a simple pattern:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Create Folder] --> B[Upload Files]
    B --> C[Create Chat]
    C --> D[Ask Questions]
    style D fill:#0285c7
```

## Step-by-Step Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Folder">
    Folders organize documents into searchable knowledge bases.

    ```python
    from cerevox import Hippo

    hippo = Hippo(api_key="your-api-key")

    # Create a folder for your documents
    folder = hippo.create_folder(
        name="Product Documentation",
        description="User guides and API docs"
    )

    print(f"Created folder: {folder.name}")
    print(f"Folder ID: {folder.id}")
    ```

    <Note>
      **Tip**: Use descriptive folder names - they help with organization when you have multiple knowledge bases.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload Files">
    Add documents to your folder from files or URLs.

    ```python
    # Upload from local file
    file1 = hippo.upload_file(
        folder_id=folder.id,
        file_path="user-guide.pdf"
    )

    # Upload from URL
    file2 = hippo.upload_file_from_url(
        folder_id=folder.id,
        file_url="https://example.com/api-docs.pdf",
        file_name="api-docs.pdf"
    )

    print(f"Uploaded: {file1.name}")
    print(f"Uploaded: {file2.name}")
    ```

    **Supported formats**: PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, TXT, HTML, CSV, and more

    <Warning>
      Large files (100+ pages) may take 2-5 minutes to process. Use async API for better performance.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Chat Session">
    Chat sessions maintain conversation context for Q&A.

    ```python
    # Create chat linked to the folder
    chat = hippo.create_chat(
        folder_id=folder.id,
        chat_name="Technical Support Q&A"
    )

    print(f"Created chat: {chat.name}")
    print(f"Chat ID: {chat.id}")
    ```

    <Note>
      **Multiple chats per folder**: You can create different chats for different purposes (e.g., "Customer Support", "Internal Q&A").
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Ask Questions">
    Submit questions and get AI-powered answers with citations!

    ```python
    # Ask a question
    answer = hippo.submit_ask(
        chat_id=chat.id,
        question="How do I authenticate users in the API?"
    )

    # Print the answer
    print(f"Question: {answer.question}")
    print(f"Answer: {answer.response}")
    print(f"Confidence: {answer.confidence_score}")

    # Show source citations
    print(f"\nSources ({len(answer.sources)} citations):")
    for source in answer.sources:
        print(f"  - {source.file_name} (Page {source.page_number})")
    ```

    <Check>
      **You're done!** You've built a RAG Q&A system with 80% cost savings! üéâ

## Complete Code Example

<CodeGroup>
```python Full Workflow
from cerevox import Hippo

# Initialize Hippo
hippo = Hippo(api_key="your-api-key")

# 1. Create folder
folder = hippo.create_folder(
    name="Product Documentation",
    description="User guides and API docs"
)

# 2. Upload files
file1 = hippo.upload_file(folder.id, "user-guide.pdf")
file2 = hippo.upload_file_from_url(
    folder.id,
    "https://example.com/api-docs.pdf",
    "api-docs.pdf"
)

# 3. Create chat
chat = hippo.create_chat(folder.id, "Technical Support")

# 4. Ask questions
questions = [
    "How do I authenticate?",
    "What are the API rate limits?",
    "How do I handle errors?"
]

for question in questions:
    answer = hippo.submit_ask(chat.id, question)
    print(f"\nQ: {question}")
    print(f"A: {answer.response}")
    print(f"Sources: {len(answer.sources)} citations")
```

```python Async Version
import asyncio
from cerevox import AsyncHippo

async def main():
    async with AsyncHippo(api_key="your-api-key") as hippo:
        # 1. Create folder
        folder = await hippo.create_folder("Product Docs")

        # 2. Upload files concurrently
        files = await asyncio.gather(
            hippo.upload_file(folder.id, "guide.pdf"),
            hippo.upload_file(folder.id, "docs.pdf")
        )

        # 3. Create chat
        chat = await hippo.create_chat(folder.id, "Support")

        # 4. Ask questions
        answer = await hippo.submit_ask(
            chat.id,
            "How do I get started?"
        )

        print(f"Answer: {answer.response}")
        print(f"Sources: {len(answer.sources)}")

# Run async workflow
asyncio.run(main())
```
</CodeGroup>

  - `relevance_score`: How relevant this source is
</ResponseField>

## Testing Your Setup

Run this verification script:

```python
from cerevox import Hippo

def test_hippo():
    hippo = Hippo(api_key="your-api-key")

    # Quick test
    folder = hippo.create_folder("Test Folder")

    # Upload test content
    test_file = hippo.upload_file(folder.id, "test.pdf")

    # Create chat and ask
    chat = hippo.create_chat(folder.id, "Test Chat")
    answer = hippo.submit_ask(chat.id, "What is this document about?")

    # Verify
    if answer and answer.response:
        print("‚úÖ Hippo is working correctly!")
        print(f"Answer: {answer.response}")
        return True
    else:
        print("‚ùå Something went wrong")
        return False

# Run test
test_hippo()
```

## Common First Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="clock" title="How long does file processing take?">
    - **Small files** (< 10 pages): 10-30 seconds
    - **Medium files** (10-100 pages): 30-120 seconds
    - **Large files** (> 100 pages): 2-5 minutes

    Files are processed automatically in the background. You can ask questions as soon as upload completes - the system will wait for indexing to finish.

    Hippo pricing is based on:
    - Number of documents uploaded
