# Folder Management

Folders are the foundation of Hippo's RAG system - they organize your documents into isolated, searchable knowledge bases.

## What are Folders?

Think of folders as **knowledge base containers**:
- Each folder holds a collection of related documents
- Documents are automatically indexed for semantic search
- Chats are linked to folders to access their documents
- Folders provide logical separation of knowledge domains

<Note>
  **Best practice**: Create separate folders for different knowledge domains (e.g., "Product Docs", "HR Policies", "Customer Support")
</Note>

## Core Operations

### Create a Folder

<CodeGroup>
```python Sync
from cerevox import Hippo

hippo = Hippo(api_key="your-api-key")

# Create folder with name and description
folder = hippo.create_folder(
    name="Product Documentation",
    description="User guides, API docs, and tutorials"
)

print(f"Created: {folder.name}")
print(f"ID: {folder.id}")
```

```python Async
from cerevox import AsyncHippo

async with AsyncHippo(api_key="your-api-key") as hippo:
    folder = await hippo.create_folder(
        name="Product Documentation",
        description="User guides and API docs"
    )
    print(f"Created: {folder.name}")
```
</CodeGroup>

**Response fields:**
- `id`: Unique folder identifier
- `name`: Folder name
- `description`: Folder description
- `created_at`: Creation timestamp
- `file_count`: Number of files in folder

### List All Folders

<CodeGroup>
```python Sync
# Get all your folders
folders = hippo.get_folders()

for folder in folders:
    print(f"{folder.name}: {folder.file_count} files")
```

```python Async
folders = await hippo.get_folders()

for folder in folders:
    print(f"{folder.name}: {folder.file_count} files")
```
</CodeGroup>

### Get Folder Details

<CodeGroup>
```python Sync
# Get specific folder by ID
folder = hippo.get_folder(folder_id="folder_123")

print(f"Name: {folder.name}")
print(f"Files: {folder.file_count}")
print(f"Created: {folder.created_at}")
```

```python Async
folder = await hippo.get_folder(folder_id="folder_123")
```
</CodeGroup>

### Update Folder

<CodeGroup>
```python Sync
# Update folder name or description
updated_folder = hippo.update_folder(
    folder_id=folder.id,
    name="Updated Product Docs",
    description="Complete product documentation library"
)

print(f"Updated: {updated_folder.name}")
```

```python Async
updated = await hippo.update_folder(
    folder_id=folder.id,
    name="Updated Name"
)
```
</CodeGroup>

### Delete Folder

<Warning>
  **Deleting a folder is permanent** and removes all files, chats, and Q&A history within it!
</Warning>

<CodeGroup>
```python Sync
# Delete folder and all its contents
hippo.delete_folder(folder_id=folder.id)

print("Folder deleted successfully")
```

```python Async
await hippo.delete_folder(folder_id=folder.id)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Folder Organization Strategies

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="building" title="By Department">
    Create folders for each department or team:
    - "Engineering Docs"
    - "Sales Playbooks"
    - "HR Policies"
    - "Customer Support"

    **Benefit**: Easy access control and logical separation
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="box-archive" title="By Product or Service">
    Organize by product lines:
    - "Product A Documentation"
    - "Product B User Guides"
    - "Service X Training Materials"

    **Benefit**: Clear product-specific knowledge bases
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="calendar" title="By Time Period">
    Useful for financial or periodic documents:
    - "Q1 2025 Reports"
    - "2024 Annual Filings"
    - "Monthly Updates - March 2025"

    **Benefit**: Easy to archive and reference historical data
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="user-group" title="By Customer or Project">
    For client-specific or project-based work:
    - "Client: Acme Corp"
    - "Project: Website Redesign"
    - "Customer: TechStartup Inc"

    **Benefit**: Isolated knowledge per client/project
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Folder Limits & Quotas

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Files per Folder" icon="file">
    **Free tier**: Up to 100 files
    **Pro tier**: Up to 10,000 files
    **Enterprise**: Unlimited

    Contact sales for custom limits
  </Card>

  <Card title="Folder Count" icon="folder">
    **Free tier**: Up to 10 folders
    **Pro tier**: Up to 100 folders
    **Enterprise**: Unlimited

    See [pricing](https://cerevox.ai/pricing)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="tag" title="Use Descriptive Names">
    **Good**: "Product API Documentation v2.0"
    **Bad**: "Docs", "Folder1", "Misc"

    Descriptive names make it easier to manage multiple folders and understand their purpose at a glance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="note" title="Add Clear Descriptions">
    ```python
    folder = hippo.create_folder(
        name="Customer Support KB",
        description="FAQs, troubleshooting guides, and product manuals for support team"
    )
    ```

    Descriptions help team members understand folder contents without exploring files.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="broom" title="Regular Cleanup">
    ```python
    # Delete old or unused folders
    folders = hippo.get_folders()

    for folder in folders:
        if folder.file_count == 0:
            print(f"Empty folder: {folder.name}")
            # Optionally delete
            # hippo.delete_folder(folder.id)
    ```

    Clean up empty or outdated folders to keep your workspace organized.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="layer-group" title="Avoid Over-Fragmentation">
    **Don't**: Create 50 folders with 2-3 files each
    **Do**: Create fewer folders with more related documents

    Folders with more documents generally yield better search results.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="shield" title="Plan for Growth">
    Start with broad categories and refine as your knowledge base grows:
    1. Start: "Product Documentation"
    2. As it grows → Split into "Product A Docs", "Product B Docs"
    3. As it grows more → Split by version or feature

    Avoid premature over-organization.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Complete Example: Manage Product Docs

```python
from cerevox import Hippo

hippo = Hippo(api_key="your-api-key")

# 1. Create folders for different product areas
folders = {}

for area in ["User Guides", "API Reference", "Tutorials", "Release Notes"]:
    folder = hippo.create_folder(
        name=f"Product Docs - {area}",
        description=f"{area} for all products"
    )
    folders[area] = folder
    print(f"Created: {folder.name}")

# 2. Upload files to appropriate folders
hippo.upload_file(folders["User Guides"].id, "getting-started.pdf")
hippo.upload_file(folders["API Reference"].id, "api-v2.pdf")
hippo.upload_file(folders["Tutorials"].id, "tutorial-basics.pdf")

# 3. List all folders and their stats
all_folders = hippo.get_folders()

print("\nFolder Summary:")
for folder in all_folders:
    print(f"  {folder.name}: {folder.file_count} files")

# 4. Clean up if needed
# hippo.delete_folder(folder_id=folders["Release Notes"].id)
```
