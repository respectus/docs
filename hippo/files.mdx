# File Operations

Upload and manage documents that power your RAG Q&A system.

## Upload Files

### Upload from Local File

<CodeGroup>
```python Sync
from cerevox import Hippo

hippo = Hippo(api_key="your-api-key")

# Upload a local file
file = hippo.upload_file(
    folder_id="folder_123",
    file_path="documents/user-guide.pdf"
)

print(f"Uploaded: {file.name}")
print(f"File ID: {file.id}")
print(f"Status: {file.status}")
```

```python Async
from cerevox import AsyncHippo

async with AsyncHippo(api_key="your-api-key") as hippo:
    file = await hippo.upload_file(
        folder_id="folder_123",
        file_path="documents/user-guide.pdf"
    )
    print(f"Uploaded: {file.name}")
```
</CodeGroup>

### Upload from URL

<CodeGroup>
```python Sync
# Upload directly from a URL
file = hippo.upload_file_from_url(
    folder_id="folder_123",
    file_url="https://example.com/whitepaper.pdf",
    file_name="whitepaper.pdf"  # Optional custom name
)

print(f"Uploaded from URL: {file.name}")
```

```python Async
file = await hippo.upload_file_from_url(
    folder_id="folder_123",
    file_url="https://example.com/document.pdf",
    file_name="document.pdf"
)
```
</CodeGroup>

### Batch Upload

<CodeGroup>
```python Sync - Sequential
files = []

for file_path in ["doc1.pdf", "doc2.docx", "doc3.pptx"]:
    file = hippo.upload_file(folder_id, file_path)
    files.append(file)
    print(f"Uploaded: {file.name}")
```

```python Async - Concurrent
import asyncio

async with AsyncHippo() as hippo:
    # Upload multiple files concurrently
    upload_tasks = [
        hippo.upload_file(folder_id, "doc1.pdf"),
        hippo.upload_file(folder_id, "doc2.docx"),
        hippo.upload_file(folder_id, "doc3.pptx")
    ]

    files = await asyncio.gather(*upload_tasks)
    print(f"Uploaded {len(files)} files concurrently")
```
</CodeGroup>

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**File size limits:**
- Max file size: 100MB per file
- Contact support for larger files or custom formats

## List Files

<CodeGroup>
```python Sync
# Get all files in a folder
files = hippo.get_files(folder_id="folder_123")

for file in files:
    print(f"{file.name} - {file.status} - {file.size_bytes} bytes")
```

```python Async
files = await hippo.get_files(folder_id="folder_123")

for file in files:
    print(f"{file.name}: {file.status}")
```
</CodeGroup>

**File status values:**
- `uploading`: File is being uploaded
- `processing`: File is being indexed
- `completed`: File is ready for Q&A
- `failed`: Processing failed

## Get File Details

<CodeGroup>
```python Sync
# Get specific file information
file = hippo.get_file(file_id="file_456")

print(f"Name: {file.name}")
print(f"Status: {file.status}")
print(f"Size: {file.size_bytes} bytes")
print(f"Pages: {file.page_count}")
print(f"Uploaded: {file.created_at}")
```

```python Async
file = await hippo.get_file(file_id="file_456")
```
</CodeGroup>

## Delete Files

<CodeGroup>
```python Sync
# Delete a file
hippo.delete_file(file_id="file_456")

print("File deleted successfully")
```

```python Async
await hippo.delete_file(file_id="file_456")
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Deleted files cannot be recovered. The file will be removed from all chats and answers that referenced it.
</Warning>

## File Processing

### Processing Time

Files are automatically processed after upload:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload">
    File is uploaded to Cerevox (a few seconds)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Parsing">
    Document is parsed for text and structure (10s - 2min)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Chunking">
    Content is split into semantic chunks (a few seconds)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Indexing">
    Chunks are indexed for search (10s - 1min)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ready">
    File is ready for Q&A!
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Total processing time:**
- Small files (< 10 pages): 10-30 seconds
- Medium files (10-100 pages): 30-120 seconds
- Large files (> 100 pages): 2-5 minutes

### Monitor Processing Status

```python
import time

# Upload file
file = hippo.upload_file(folder_id, "large-document.pdf")

# Poll until processing completes
while file.status != "completed":
    time.sleep(5)
    file = hippo.get_file(file.id)
    print(f"Status: {file.status}")

print("File ready for Q&A!")
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="file-check" title="Verify File Quality">
    **Before uploading:**
    - Ensure PDFs are text-based (not scanned images)
    - Check that documents aren't password-protected
    - Verify file isn't corrupted

    **Tip**: OCR (scanned) PDFs work but may have lower accuracy. Use text-based PDFs when possible.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="scissors" title="Optimize File Size">
    **Reduce processing time:**
    - Remove unnecessary pages (covers, blanks, ads)
    - Compress images in PDFs
    - Split very large documents (500+ pages)

    Smaller, focused documents = faster processing + better search results
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="layer-group" title="Upload Related Documents Together">
    ```python
    # Good: Upload product docs together
    folder = hippo.create_folder("Product V2 Docs")

    docs = ["overview.pdf", "features.pdf", "api.pdf"]
    for doc in docs:
        hippo.upload_file(folder.id, doc)
    ```

    Related documents in the same folder enable better cross-document Q&A.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="tag" title="Use Descriptive Filenames">
    **Good**: `product-api-authentication-guide.pdf`
    **Bad**: `doc1.pdf`, `untitled.pdf`

    Descriptive names help with source citations and debugging.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="clock" title="Use Async for Batch Uploads">
    ```python
    # Async = 10x faster for multiple files
    async with AsyncHippo() as hippo:
        tasks = [hippo.upload_file(folder_id, f) for f in files]
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    ```

    Async concurrent uploads are significantly faster than sequential.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Complete Example: Batch Upload

```python
import asyncio
from pathlib import Path
from cerevox import AsyncHippo

async def batch_upload_directory(folder_id, directory_path):
    """Upload all PDFs from a directory"""
    async with AsyncHippo(api_key="your-api-key") as hippo:
        # Get all PDF files
        pdf_files = list(Path(directory_path).glob("*.pdf"))

        print(f"Found {len(pdf_files)} PDF files")

        # Upload concurrently
        tasks = [
            hippo.upload_file(folder_id, str(pdf))
            for pdf in pdf_files
        ]

        files = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

        # Report results
        print(f"\nâœ… Uploaded {len(files)} files:")
        for file in files:
            print(f"  - {file.name} ({file.status})")

        return files

# Usage
folder = await hippo.create_folder("Uploaded Docs")
files = await batch_upload_directory(folder.id, "./documents")
```

## Error Handling

```python
from cerevox import Hippo, HippoError

hippo = Hippo()

try:
    file = hippo.upload_file(folder_id, "document.pdf")
    print(f"Uploaded: {file.name}")

except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: File not found")
except HippoError as e:
    if "unsupported format" in str(e).lower():
        print("Error: File format not supported")
    elif "too large" in str(e).lower():
        print("Error: File exceeds size limit")
    else:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
```
